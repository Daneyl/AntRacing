# AntRacing

To run the project you will need the basic React Native setup. If you don't have that follow the steps from 
here (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) to have the basic setup.

Steps:
- Clone the repo into your local machine
- navigate to the project repository
- run the command "npm install" or "yarn install"
- now navigate into the ios folder by running the command "cd ios"
- Inside the ios folder run the command "pod install"
- now navigate back again to the project repo by "cd .."
- now run the command "yarn ios" to run on iOS and "react-native run-android" for Android(make sure your emulator is running
  for for Android)

Hope that helps... :)
